    - **No:** View existing sales orders.

- **Node:** Create Sales Order
  - **Description:** User selects products, quantity, customer, and shipping mode.
  - **Action:** Generate Invoice and update inventory.

    - **No:** Store data locally for future sync.

- **Node:** Process Shipping
  - **Description:** User tracks the shipping process and updates order status.
  - **Action:** Update Shipping and Inventory Database.
  - **Decision:** Is the system online?
    - **Yes:** Sync with the server.
    - **No:** Store data locally for future sync.

### **7. User Access Control**

- **Node:** Manage Users
  - **Description:** User (Admin) manages user roles and permissions.
  - **Decision:** Does the Admin want to add/edit a user?
    - **Yes:** Proceed to Add/Edit User.
    - **No:** View user list.

- **Node:** Add/Edit User
  - **Description:** Admin enters user details and assigns roles.
  - **Action:** Save user data locally.
  - **Decision:** Is the system online?
    - **Yes:** Sync with the server.
    - **No:** Store data locally for future sync.

### **8. Reports and Analytics**

- **Node:** Generate Reports
  - **Description:** User generates reports based on inventory, sales, or purchase data.
  - **Action:** View/Download reports.

  - **Action:** Resolve conflicts and update the server.

### **10. Logout**

- **Node:** Logout
  - **Description:** User logs out of the system.
  - **Action:** End session and return to the Start.

### **Flowchart Design**

Using a flowchart tool (like Lucidchart, Draw.io, or Visio), you can design the flowchart with the following visual elements:

- **Ovals:** Represent start and end points (Start, Logout).
- **Rectangles:** Represent processes or actions (e.g., Manage Inventory, Create Purchase Order).
- **Diamonds:** Represent decisions (e.g., Is the system online?).
- **Arrows:** Indicate the flow of actions and decisions.

The visual flowchart will help users understand how the app works and guide developers during the implementation phase.
